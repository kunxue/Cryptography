The objective of this week programming assignment is to explore the java cryptography extensions package. Your task is to design and implement a simple public key encryption and decryption program in java using the RSA or the DSA method. Your program takes the content of this email and maps it to ciphertext and then back to plaintext. You must prepare a short presentation that explain how you used the java cryptography extension api to implement your solution. Please refer the sun site for details. Also, if there are enhancement to strengthen your solution will be greatly appreciated. This assignment is due on Wednesday 1/27.
